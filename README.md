# Rainfall Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict rainfall probability based on meteorological data. The model is developed using the CatBoost algorithm, which is well-suited for handling categorical data and provides robust performance on predictive tasks. The primary objective is to accurately forecast the likelihood of rainfall based on input features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed etc..

## Features

- **Accurate Rainfall Prediction**: The model predicts the probability of rainfall using input meteorological data.
- **CatBoost Algorithm**: Utilizes the CatBoost machine learning algorithm, which is optimized for categorical features and delivers high accuracy.
- **Model Serialization**: The trained model is serialized into a .pkl file, enabling easy reuse and deployment.
