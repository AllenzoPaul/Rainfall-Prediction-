# Rainfall Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict rainfall probability based on meteorological data. The model is developed using the CatBoost algorithm, which is well-suited for handling categorical data and provides robust performance on predictive tasks. This project is reccommended as an intermediate machine learning and data science project.

## Features

- **Accurate Rainfall Prediction**: The model predicts the probability of rainfall using input meteorological data.
- **CatBoost Algorithm**: Utilizes the CatBoost machine learning algorithm, which is optimized for categorical features and delivers high accuracy.
- **Model Serialization**: The trained model is serialized into a .pkl file, enabling easy reuse and deployment.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
